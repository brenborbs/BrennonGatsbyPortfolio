# Hey There!

My name is Brennon Borbon and I'm a full-stack web developer. I build back-ends using Node js with frameworks such as Express js. I use React js, Gatsby js and more to build enjoyable user experiences on the front-end.

In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my family and play rock and roll with my custom Fender Telecaster Guitar.
