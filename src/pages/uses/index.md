My set up changes every so often, but I'll try to keep an up-to-date list of the stuff I'm using. If you're interested in the various tools I use when developing, you can find a list of them here.

### Hardware

- **[2015 Macbook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/)**: This computer is my workhorse. I do most of my work here.
- **[Apple Magic Mouse 2](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA02LL/A/magic-mouse-2-silver?fnode=56)**: I never leave home without this bluetooth mouse.
- **[Apple Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA22LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english?fnode=56)**: A secondary keyboard I use when I want to mix things up.
- **[Apple Earpods](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMTN2AM/A/earpods-with-lightning-connector?fnode=c04a91b92678760e3fc4ced567fd903cfc1dcf7a3e98cae7ad5fd8505d5f561cd13c3e79cabb9ed4dcbae4324a47205dcf2df6c7649d8f4fddc0d950c72fd588a760adb8df1c54d0fed0e50d411ce05c342afb203554cb0170abf81bc98b0a9f6f3ae4da8e44f67daccb3c56f93a122e9e2ee1502f53b13e5af34b9c8864acb5)**: The headphones I use most of the time.
